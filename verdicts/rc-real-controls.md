## #246: cause check before READY

Date: 2026-10-11.
Head: `a8d9a156401288226d0ad8922fff65db64ddb4da`.
Base: `8dab35d1`.
Risk: HIGH. The change modifies the shared testkit.
Status: This is a limited cause check. The implementer has not sent READY. This check gives no CLEAN verdict.

**#246's change does not alter the cause of the `ev_5` step-21 `PendingLimit` failure.**

The reviewer read all four changed files against the base. The reviewer also read the transcript at `contracts-v0.1.29`.

- The transcript requires only `edges_quiet`. It never calls `fail_handoff`.
- Each new tap starts with `fail_handoff: false`. Only `fail_next_handoff` arms that flag.
- During this transcript, `link_send_descriptor` takes the false flag and calls the same inner edge with the same arguments.
- The change adds no wait, event poll, or operation completion on this path. It does not change slot admission or slot release.
- R-63 identifies the recovery race: `poll_all` can run before worker completions arrive. `await_quiet` does not wait for those completions.
- R-64 identifies the separate v1 trigger: the worker cannot receive descriptors. #246 does not change the worker's descriptor intake.

The reviewer read this gate log:
`/Users/jasonconigliari/botster-sessions/gates/botster-core-stage1-rc-fail-handoff-a8d9a156-pool-20261011-020457-95993.log`.
Its summary reports a passing slow step, a failing unmutated stage-2 baseline, and no fuzz run.
The failing baseline names `conf::ev_5_repeated_attach_detach_without_polling_stays_bounded`.
The implementer supplied the step-21 error detail. The gate summary does not contain that detail.

This check satisfies only the reviewer's cause confirmation in plan 23al, section 8.
The lead must verify the trace evidence, reproduction on plain v1, and written approval for one re-gate.
The reviewer ran no test or gate. The full review, all exclusion checks, and exact-head evidence review remain pending.
