## PR #247: optimize sha2

VERDICT: CLEAN

- Reviewed head: `14cde79e46da90b83079b15ce463d833364a1ef6`.
- Base: `f6778ad85c01266ac49e2ededd97487da689e920`.
- Risk tier: HIGH.
- Open findings: 0, including LOW.
- Review date: 2026-10-11.

The diff changes only `Cargo.toml`. It sets the sha2 dev-profile optimization level to 3. Debug assertions and overflow checks remain enabled.

The candidate verification code, test selection, timeout constants, mutation selection, and mutation verdict remain unchanged. No Core workspace crate receives an optimization override.

The faster hash does not remove a verification. Each harness still verifies the candidate binaries against the manifest. This PR changes no binary dependency or mutant build rule.

The prebuilt worker gap remains: mutation runs do not rebuild `target/candidate` for each mutant. This PR adds no exclusion or acceptance for that gap.

I found no path in this diff that passes a mutant or test that the current gate would reject. This conclusion covers this diff only.

The PR includes the required Prior art note. It names the existing #223 profile overrides and states that no old code is reused.

### Evidence

I inspected the Linux gate log for the exact reviewed head:

`~/botster-sessions/gates/botster-core-stage1-gs-sha2-opt-14cde79e-pool-20261011-010427-15764.log`

All ten gate steps report PASS. The gate exits 0. Mutation testing reports no Rust source change. This result is not mutant comparison evidence.

I compared the PASS names from the first slow-suite run in each evidence log:

- `~/botster-sessions/gates/botster-core-gs-sha2-before-7e8e07d6-evidence.log`
- `~/botster-sessions/gates/botster-core-gs-sha2-after-d1ccfe9b-evidence.log`

Both runs pass exactly the same 412 test names. The slow-suite wall time changes from 109.0 seconds to 29.3 seconds.

These evidence runs use the earlier base `7e8e07d6` and candidate head `d1ccfe9b`. Their Cargo.toml change equals the reviewed diff. The final gate covers the exact reviewed head.

I ran no gate, build, or test. I inspected the source, PR description, and retained logs.

This CLEAN applies only to PR #247 at the reviewed head. It does not cover the candidate cache, in-place mutation run, or baseline reuse changes.
