# Core Daemon

`botster-core-daemon` is the production core daemon layer over `botster-core`.
It owns daemon mechanics: persistent registry metadata, session supervision
state, attach/input/resize/output routing through the existing core engine,
readiness-gated guarded writes, adoption scans, health, and shutdown.

Session workers still own PTYs and terminal/session evidence. The daemon
records only non-sensitive metadata needed for discovery and adoption: session
id, process identity, lifecycle state, terminal size, protocol version,
handshake/liveness booleans, optional recovery identity, timestamps, and a
scrubbed command label. It does not persist PTY bytes, scrollback, credentials,
auth state, workflow records, or product routing policy. A registry record is
adoptable only after the daemon has observed the session-worker restart
contract: HELLO/WELCOME protocol negotiation, FRAME_PING/PONG liveness support,
and `SessionMetadata.recovery_identity`. Local in-process spawns that have not
produced those protocol facts remain `missing_protocol_evidence`, not
`adoptable`.

The typed Rust API is the embedder and hub path. The CLI is intentionally thin
operator/dev/debug tooling over that same API and requires `--data-dir` so
smoke runs do not depend on ambient home directories.

Guarded writes use explicit daemon delivery states: accepted, deferred,
rejected, written, delivered, and acknowledged. Acceptance means only that the
daemon received a valid typed request. Written means bytes were injected through
the existing PTY input path. Delivered and acknowledged require downstream
proof; plain PTY input does not currently provide that proof, so the daemon does
not fabricate those states.

Readiness evidence is currently a host-supplied composite over core-owned facts
such as terminal mode flags, cursor visibility, prompt evidence,
snapshot/screen availability, and safe-write indicators. The daemon validates
that composite fail-closed. Missing safe-write evidence defers the write instead
of guessing. Unsafe evidence rejects it. A future synchronous readiness API can
move more evidence sourcing inside the daemon without changing these delivery
states.

Hub, hosts, and plugins remain responsible for auth, marketplace/cloud/WebRTC
policy, product copy, spawn target admission, notification meaning, UI
presentation, and retention policy.
